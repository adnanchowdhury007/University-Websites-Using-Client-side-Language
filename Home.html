<br><p>The Department of Computer Science and Engineering strives for graduating highly competent students with the potential of becoming the leaders in their field and also to impart knowledge which allows them to understand the implications of their work on both to themselves as well to the society as a whole.<br>

Department of Computer Science and Engineering at ULAB, since its inception, has been offering an undergraduate program in Computer Science and Engineering with focus on developing skills for ICT industries worldwide. The designed program provides students with fundamental skills needed to become an accomplished IT specialist. The program also aims at a wider knowledge of the subject, rather than a mere understanding of the existing commercial approaches. The degree is designed for a wide range of students, including those who wish to pursue a career in software engineering, computer programming or related areas, and also those who wish to move on to study for higher degrees in the computing and information technology areas, either at home or abroad.</p><br>

<br><p>The department believes in a philosophy of Active Learning which is reflected in our curriculum and teaching styles. The Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) curriculum has been designed with both theoretical and industry oriented courses. The department provides state of the art laboratory facilities, with guidance from the top notch faculties, to bring out the best from the students. Departmental active collaboration with local and international reputed companies is keeping both CSE students and faculty updated with industry innovations and requirements. In their last academic year, students will be able to choose a concentration area or any other elective courses to focus their career according to their interest. Furthermore, the Liberal Arts curricular framework will help the students to acquire an openness of vision to become adaptable and ever-effective professionals of this century and for the time to come. The program objectives address our goal of graduating highly competent students with a potential of becoming leaders in their careers and add value to the society.<br>
